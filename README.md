# Saudi-Stock-Exchange
Comprehensive analysis and predictive modelling of Tadawul, the Saudi Stock Exchange platform. 

## Introduction
This project provides an extensive analysis of the Tadawul Saudi Stock Market, aiming to uncover underlying patterns, assess liquidity, and understand the volatility of its components. The analysis spans several years and covers a wide array of companies across different sectors.

## About the Dataset
The dataset comprises over 500,000 records and 14 columns, totaling to around 7 million data values. It includes various attributes such as trading date, opening price, closing price, high, low, trading volume, and trading value, providing a comprehensive view of the market's trading activities.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA section, we delve into the dataset to understand its structure, identify any missing or outlier values, and prepare it for further analysis. This foundational step is crucial as it ensures the accuracy and reliability of our findings. 

## Volatility Analysis
We conduct a volatility analysis to understand the levels of risk and uncertainty in the market. This includes calculating daily returns and rolling volatility, which helps in identifying periods of high and low market stability.

## Liquidity Analysis
Liquidity analysis is performed to assess how easily assets can be bought or sold in the market without causing a significant impact on their prices. This section helps in identifying the most liquid sectors and companies in the market.

We analyze the distribution of trade volumes across different sectors, visualized through a market share donut chart. This provides a clear view of which sectors dominate the market in terms of trading activity.

## Predictive Modelling: GARCH
The GARCH model is applied to forecast future volatility, providing a quantifiable measure of market risk. This model helps in understanding the potential risk levels in future trading activities.

## Monte Carlo Simulation
We conduct a Monte Carlo Simulation to generate a range of possible future stock price scenarios. This probabilistic approach provides insights into potential risks and rewards, aiding in investment decision-making.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis has provided a deep dive into the Saudi stock market, uncovering its behavior, risks, and opportunities. While we have gained valuable insights, it is important to note that the financial landscape is ever-evolving.
